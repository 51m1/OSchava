# OSchava

The project contins three four different classes:
- worder.java is meant to solve the first exersise about finding the inique leter in a word.
- nodo.java and list.java are used to make a inked list, my aproach to solving the secong problem, about finding the median of a list of     numbers.
- notinlist.java revolves around the third problem, making a list of random numbers within a desired range and randomly finding a number     NOT included in said list.

The project was created and tested using Eclipse Photon for Java.

Performance:
- worder.java: It takes around 450000 ns to solve the problem with short words. It has an n*n complexity (as far as i can tell).
- list.java: It takes user input, calculating the runtime is complicated because of this. For adding new numbers to the list it takes at     best n and n*n at worst. For calcuating the median we get an n/2 complexity.
- notinlist.java:
